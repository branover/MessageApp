# What?

**MessageApp** is a messaging application that seeks to achieve the following goals in communication security:

- End-to-end encryption
- Anonymous (aside from a unique alias)
- Peer-to-peer
- Near-serverless (peer discovery only)
- Local confidentiality (secure storage of private keys, volatile message storage only)
- Non-repudiation and sender authentication
